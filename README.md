## Non-City Authors

### Overview
This part of the project involves the geocoding and visualization of authors from small cities, retrieved from the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) by Eric Chaney.

- **Dataset**: The dataset used contains author names, authors index, their birth and death years, birth, death, and active cities, the VIAF URL and  a georeference URL.
- The original dataset had encoding issues with some names. These encoding errors were mostly corrected using this script: 
[preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/lorenafc/Capita_Selecta_RHI50403/blob/main/preprocessing.ipynb)

- **Geocoding Scripts**:
  - The geocoding of the locations is performed using Google Maps API, and cities not successfully geocoded are handled with the OpenAI API. Remaining locations will be done manually.

  - **preprocessing_GoogleAPI.py (In Progress)**: Uses Google Maps API to geocode cities according to a historical context, adding flags for cities geocoded incorrectly (e.g., those appearing in the Americas and Oceania before their discovery). Replace `API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"` with your own key.

  - **preprocessing_openAI_API.py** (Optional): Geocodes the remaining cities not geocoded by Google Maps API using OpenAIâ€™s API, considering historical context. Replace `openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'` with your own key.

- **Visualization**: A mapping script generates maps of author activity hotspots for each year from 800 to 1800 AD, displaying author locations on world maps and creating an animated GIF or video.
